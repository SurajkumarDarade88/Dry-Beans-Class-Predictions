Complete EDA is performed on the dataset using pandas and numpy.
Outliers are detected in the data in large numbers so capping method is used to remove the outliers.
Skewness is detected in the data so yeo-jhonson method is used to deal with the skewness.
Different Machine Learning models are used to check the accuracies.
The model was overfitted in the Decision Tree so Hyperparameter tunning is done.
Random Forest & Logistic Regression gives the 92% accuracy best from the rest models.
